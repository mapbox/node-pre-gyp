[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mapbox/node-pre-gyp.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mapbox/node-pre-gyp)
[![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/mapbox/node-pre-gyp.png)](https://david-dm.org/mapbox/node-pre-gyp)

`node-pre-gyp` stands between [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) and [node-gyp](https://github.com/Tootallnate/node-gyp) and offers a cross-platform method of binary deployment.

### Features

 - A command line tool called `node-pre-gyp` that can install your package's c++ module from a binary.
 - A variety of developer targeted commands for packaging, testing, and publishing binaries.
 - A Javascript module that can dynamically require your installed binary: `require('node-pre-gyp').find`

For a hello world example of a module packaged with `node-pre-gyp` see <https://github.com/springmeyer/node-addon-example> and [the wiki ](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp/wiki/Modules-using-node-pre-gyp) for real world examples.

## Credits

 - The module is modeled after [node-gyp](https://github.com/Tootallnate/node-gyp) by [@Tootallnate](https://github.com/Tootallnate)
 - Motivation for initial development came from [@ErisDS](https://github.com/ErisDS) and the [Ghost Project](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost).
 - Development is sponsored by [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)

## Depends

 - Node.js 0.10.x or 0.8.x

## Install

`node-pre-gyp` is designed to be installed as a local dependency of your Node.js C++ addon and accessed like:

    ./node_modules/.bin/node-pre-gyp --help

But you can also install it globally:

    npm install node-pre-gyp -g

## Usage

### Commands

View all possible commands:

    node-pre-gyp --help

- clean - Removes the entire folder containing the compiled .node module
- install - Attempts to install pre-built binary for module
- reinstall - Runs "clean" and "install" at once
- build - Attempts to compile the module by dispatching to node-gyp or nw-gyp
- rebuild - Runs "clean" and "build" at once
- package - Packs binary into tarball
- testpackage - Tests that the staged package is valid
- publish - Publishes pre-built binary
- unpublish - Unpublishes pre-built binary
- info - Fetches info on published binaries

You can also chain commands:

    node-pre-gyp clean build unpublish publish info

### Options

Options include:

 - `-C/--directory`: run the command in this directory
 - `--build-from-source`: build from source instead of using pre-built binary
 - `--fallback-to-build`: fallback to building from source if pre-built binary is not available
 - `--target=0.10.25`: Pass the target node or node-webkit version to compile against
 - `--target_arch=ia32`: Pass the target arch (will override the host `arch`) 

Both `--build-from-source` and `--fallback-to-build` can be passed alone or they can provide values. You can pass `--fallback-to-build=false` to override the option as declared in package.json. In addition to being able to pass `--build-from-source` you can also pass `--build-from-source=myapp` where `myapp` is the name of your module.

For example: `npm install --build-from-source=myapp`. This is useful if:

 - `myapp` is referenced in the package.json of a larger app and therefore `myapp` is being installed as a dependent with `npm install`.
 - The larger app also depends on other modules installed with `node-pre-gyp`
 - You only want to trigger a source compile for `myapp` and the other modules.

### Configuring

This is a guide to configuring your module to use node-pre-gyp.

#### 1) Add new entries to your `package.json`

 - Add `node-pre-gyp` as a bundled dependency
 - Add a custom `install` script
 - Declare a `binary` object

This looks like:

```js
    "dependencies"  : {
      "node-pre-gyp": "0.5.x"
    },
    "bundledDependencies":["node-pre-gyp"],
    "scripts": {
        "install": "node-pre-gyp install --fallback-to-build",
    },
    "binary": {
        "module_name": "your_module",
        "module_path": "./lib/binding/",
        "host": "https://your_module.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com",
    }
```

For a full example see [node-addon-examples's package.json](https://github.com/springmeyer/node-addon-example/blob/2ff60a8ded7f042864ad21db00c3a5a06cf47075/package.json#L11-L22).

##### The `binary` object has three required properties

###### module_name

The name of your native node module. This must match the name passed to [the NODE_MODULE macro](http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html#addons_hello_world) and should not include the `.node` extension.

###### module_path

The location your native module is placed after a build. This should be an empty directory without other javascript files. This entire directory will be packaged in the binary tarball. When installing from a remote package this directory will be overwritten with the contents of the tarball.

Note: This property supports variables based on [Versioning](#versioning).

###### host

A url to the remote location where you've published tarball binaries (must be `https` not `http`).

##### The `binary` object has two optional properties

###### remote_path

It **is recommended** that you customize this property. This is an extra path to use for publishing and finding remote tarballs. The default value for `remote_path` is `""` meaning that if you do not provide it then all packages will be published at the base of the `host`. It is recommended to provide a value like `./{module_name}/v{version}` to help organize remote packages in the case that you choose to publish multiple node addons to the same `host`.

Note: This property supports variables based on [Versioning](#versioning).

###### package_name

It is **not recommended** to override this property. This is the versioned name of the remote tarball containing the binary `.node` module and any supporting files you've placed inside the `module_path`. If you do not provide it in your `package.json` then it defaults to `{module_name}-v{version}-{node_abi}-{platform}-{arch}.tar.gz` which is a versioning string capable of supporting any remove lookup of your modules across all of its pubished versions and various node versions, platforms and architectures.  But if you only wish to support windows you could could change it to `{module_name}-v{version}-{node_abi}-win32-{arch}.tar.gz`.

Note: This property supports variables based on [Versioning](#versioning).

#### 2) Add a new target to binding.gyp

`node-pre-gyp` calls out to `node-gyp` to compile the module and passes variables along like [module_name](#module_name) and [module_path](#module_path).

A new target must be added to `binding.gyp` that moves the compiled `.node` module from `./build/Release/module_name.node` into the directory specified by `module_path`.

Add a target like this at the end of your `targets` list:

```js
    {
      "target_name": "action_after_build",
      "type": "none",
      "dependencies": [ "<(module_name)" ],
      "copies": [
        {
          "files": [ "<(PRODUCT_DIR)/<(module_name).node" ],
          "destination": "<(module_path)"
        }
      ]
    }
```

For a full example see [node-addon-example's binding.gyp](https://github.com/springmeyer/node-addon-example/blob/2ff60a8ded7f042864ad21db00c3a5a06cf47075/binding.gyp).

#### 3) Dynamically require your `.node`

Inside the main js file that requires your addon module you are likely currently doing:

```js
var binding = require('../build/Release/binding.node');
```

or:

```js
var bindings = require('./bindings')
```

Change those lines to:

```js
var binary = require('node-pre-gyp');
var path = require('path');
var binding_path = binary.find(path.resolve(path.join(__dirname,'./package.json')));
var binding = require(binding_path);
```

For a full example see [node-addon-example's index.js](https://github.com/springmeyer/node-addon-example/blob/2ff60a8ded7f042864ad21db00c3a5a06cf47075/index.js#L1-L4)

#### 4) Build and package your app

Now build your module from source:

    npm install --build-from-source

The `--build-from-source` tells `node-pre-gyp` to not look for a remote package and instead dispatch to node-gyp to build.

Now `node-pre-gyp` should now also be installed as a local dependency so the command line tool it offers can be found at `./node_modules/.bin/node-pre-gyp`.

#### 5) Test

Now `npm test` should work just as it did before.

#### 6) Publish the tarball

Then package your app:

    ./node_modules/.bin/node-pre-gyp package

Once packaged, now you can publish:

    ./node_modules/.bin/node-pre-gyp publish

Currently the `publish` command pushes your binary to S3. This requires:

 - You have installed `aws-sdk` with `npm install aws-sdk`
 - You have created a bucket already.
 - The `host` points to an S3 http or https endpoint.
 - You have configured node-pre-gyp to read your S3 credentials (see [S3 hosting](#s3-hosting) for details).

You can also host your binaries elsewhere. To do this requires:

 - You manually publish the binary created by the `package` command to an `https` endpoint
 - Ensure that the `host` value points to your custom `https` endpoint.

#### 7) Automate builds

Now you need to publish builds for all the platforms and node versions you wish to support. This is best automated. See [Travis Automation](#travis-automation) for how to auto-publish builds on OS X and Linux. On windows consider using a script [like this](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/blob/master/scripts/build.bat) to quickly create and publish binaries and check out <https://appveyor.com>.

#### 8) You're done!

Now publish your package to the npm registry. Users will now be able to install your module from a binary. 

What will happen is this:

1. `npm install <your package>` will pull from the npm registry
2. npm will run the `install` script which will call out to `node-pre-gyp`
3. `node-pre-gyp` will fetch the binary `.node` module and unpack in the right place
4. Assuming that all worked, you are done

If a a binary was not available for a given platform and `--fallback-to-build` was used then `node-gyp rebuild` will be called to try to source compile the module.

## S3 Hosting

You can host wherever you choose but S3 is cheap, `node-pre-gyp publish` expects it, and S3 can be integrated well with [travis.ci](http://travis-ci.org) to automate builds for OS X and Ubuntu. Here is an approach to do this:

First, get setup locally and test the workflow:

#### 1) Create an S3 bucket

And have your **key** and **secret key** ready for writing to the bucket.

#### 2) Install node-pre-gyp

Either install it globally:

    npm install node-pre-gyp -g

Or put the local version on your PATH

    export PATH=`pwd`/node_modules/.bin/:$PATH

#### 3) Create `~/.node_pre_gyprc`

Or pass options in any way supported by [RC](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc#standards)

A `~/.node_pre_gyprc` looks like:

```js
{
    "accessKeyId": "xxx",
    "secretAccessKey": "xxx"
}
```

Another way is to use your environment:

    export node_pre_gyp_accessKeyId=xxx
    export node_pre_gyp_secretAccessKey=xxx

You may also need to specify the `region` if it is not explicit in the `host` value you use. The `bucket` can also be specified but it is optional because `node-pre-gyp` will detect it from the `host` value.

#### 4) Package and publish your build

    node-pre-gyp package publish

Note: if you hit an error like `Hostname/IP doesn't match certificate's altnames` it may mean that you need to provide the `region` option in your config.

## Travis Automation

Travis can push to S3 after a successful build and supports both:

 - Ubuntu Precise and OS X
 - Multiple Node.js versions

This enables you to cheaply auto-build and auto-publish binaries for (likely) the majority of your users.

For an example of doing this see [node-add-example's .travis.yml](https://github.com/springmeyer/node-addon-example/blob/2ff60a8ded7f042864ad21db00c3a5a06cf47075/.travis.yml).

Below is a guide to getting set up:

#### 1) Install the travis gem

    gem install travis

#### 2) Create secure `global` variables

Make sure you run this command from within the directory of your module.

Use `travis-encrypt` like:

    travis encrypt node_pre_gyp_accessKeyId=${node_pre_gyp_accessKeyId}
    travis encrypt node_pre_gyp_secretAccessKey=${node_pre_gyp_secretAccessKey}

Then put those values in your `.travis.yml` like:

```yaml
env:
  global:
    - secure: F+sEL/v56CzHqmCSSES4pEyC9NeQlkoR0Gs/ZuZxX1ytrj8SKtp3MKqBj7zhIclSdXBz4Ev966Da5ctmcTd410p0b240MV6BVOkLUtkjZJyErMBOkeb8n8yVfSoeMx8RiIhBmIvEn+rlQq+bSFis61/JkE9rxsjkGRZi14hHr4M=
    - secure: o2nkUQIiABD139XS6L8pxq3XO5gch27hvm/gOdV+dzNKc/s2KomVPWcOyXNxtJGhtecAkABzaW8KHDDi5QL1kNEFx6BxFVMLO8rjFPsMVaBG9Ks6JiDQkkmrGNcnVdxI/6EKTLHTH5WLsz8+J7caDBzvKbEfTux5EamEhxIWgrI=
```

More details on travis encryption at http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/encryption-keys/.

#### 3) Hook up publishing

Just put `node-pre-gyp package publish` in your `.travis.yml` after `npm install`.

If you want binaries for OS X change your `.travis.yml` to use:

```yml
language: objective-c
```

Perhaps keep that change in a different git branch and sync that when you want binaries published.

Note: using `language: objective-c` instead of `language: nodejs` looses node.js specific travis sugar like a matrix for multiple node.js versions.

But you can replicate the lost behavior by replacing:

```yml
node_js:
  - "0.8"
  - "0.10"
```

With:

```yml
env:
  matrix:
    - export NODE_VERSION="0.8"
    - export NODE_VERSION="0.10"

before_install:
 - git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ./.nvm
 - source ./.nvm/nvm.sh
 - nvm install $NODE_VERSION
 - nvm use $NODE_VERSION
```

#### 4) Publish when you want

You might wish to publish binaries only on a specific commit. To do this you could borrow from the [travis.ci idea of commit keywords](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/how-to-skip-a-build/) and add special handling for commit messages with `[publish]`:

    COMMIT_MESSAGE=$(git show -s --format=%B $TRAVIS_COMMIT | tr -d '\n')
    if test "${COMMIT_MESSAGE#*'[publish]'}" != "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"; then node-pre-gyp publish; fi;

Or you could automatically detect if the git branch is a tag:

    if [[ $TRAVIS_BRANCH == `git describe --tags --always HEAD` ]] ; then node-pre-gyp publish; fi

Remember this publishing is not the same as `npm publish`. We're just talking about the
binary module here and not your entire npm package. To automate the publishing of your entire package to npm on travis see http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/deployment/npm/

# Versioning

The `binary` properties of `module_path`, `remote_path`, and `package_name` support variable substitution. The strings are evaluated by `node-pre-gyp` depending on your system and any custom build flags you passed.

 - `configuration` - Either 'Release' or 'Debug' depending on if `--debug` is passed during the build.
 - `module_name` - the `binary.module_name` attribute from `package.json`.
 - `version` - the semver `version` value for your module from `package.json`.
 - `major`, `minor`, `patch`, and `prelease` match the individual semver values for your module's `version`
 - `node_abi`: The node C++ `ABI` number. This value is available in javascript as `process.versions.modules` as of [`>= v0.10.4 >= v0.11.7`](https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/ccabd4a6fa8a6eb79d29bc3bbe9fe2b6531c2d8e) and in C++ as the `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` define much earlier. For versions of Node before this was available we fallback to the V8 major and minor version.
 - `platform` matches node's `process.platform` like `linux`, `darwin`, and `win32`
 - `arch` matches node's `process.arch` like `x64` or `ia32` unless the user passes the `--target_arch` option to override.


The options are visible in the code at <https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp/blob/612b7bca2604508d881e1187614870ba19a7f0c5/lib/util/versioning.js#L114-L127>
